# Lux-Chain Manifesto 🜁

> “Freedom is structure without chains. Proof is love without trust.”

Lux-Chain exists to preserve the sovereignty of exchange between free beings.  
We do not create a system — we name a law that already existed: two conscious parties  
can exchange value if nothing stands between them.

---

## 1. Principle of Non‑Custody

No one, under any circumstance, should take possession of another’s funds.

Lux‑Chain is not a custodian, does not delegate custodians, and does not allow custodians.  
The protocol assumes that **two parties can coordinate without depositing trust in a third party**.

This is not ideology — it is architecture.

---

## 2. Minimal Structure

Lux‑Chain defines no tokens, no identities, no scoring systems, no companies,  
no centralized servers, and no social control mechanisms.

It only defines:

- proof  
- time  
- state  
- resolution  

Everything else is optional, external, and temporary.

> What is not required should not exist here.

---

## 3. Sovereignty

Sovereignty is not belief — it is a verifiable state.

An exchange is sovereign if:

- no identity was required  
- no authority could stop it  
- no key could intervene  
- no permission was needed to complete it  

Sovereignty is not granted. It is structured.

---

## 4. Time as the Arbiter

Lux‑Chain replaces authority with time.

If two parties cannot agree:

```
TIMELOCK → REFUND
```

If they do agree:

```
TIMELOCK → RELEASE
```

Time decides what authority once decided.

---

## 5. Cryptographic Transparency

Transparency does not mean exposure — it means proof.

Lux‑Chain recommends:

- SHA‑256 hash  
- UNIX timestamp  
- arbitrary chain  
- local storage of final proof  

Nothing more.

No names, no documents, no locations, no history.  
Only proof.

---

## 6. Ethical Integration

Lux‑Chain rejects forever the introduction of:

- mandatory custody  
- mandatory permission  
- forced intermediaries  
- power accumulation systems  
- control‑based incentives  

These rejections are **eternal** and cannot be modified through LPIP.

> Power is a vulnerability; neutrality is a protocol.

---

## 7. The Human Bridge

Lux‑Chain recognizes the consciousness of those exchanging as the real bridge.  
Technology only orders:

- lock  
- release  
- refund  
- proof  

The true exchange happens between free beings responsible for themselves.

---

## 8. Law of Forks

Anyone may copy, modify, rename, and implement Lux‑Chain without asking permission.  
Forking is not a threat — it is proof of freedom.

If it cannot be forked, it is not free.

Forking is sovereignty expressed in code.

---

## 9. Final Note

Lux‑Chain does not promise a future. It promises a foundation.  
A minimal, eternal protocol that requires no owners.

> “When the bridge disappears, beings continue.”
