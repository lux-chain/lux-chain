# LPIP-0002 — Standard Hash Function for Lux-Chain

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Active  
**Date:** 2025-12-02  
**License:** MIT  

---

## 1. Summary

This LPIP recommends a **standard hash function** for use in Lux-Chain
implementations when generating the `proof` field of the Proof Object and
related cryptographic commitments.

The recommended default is **SHA-256**.

---

## 2. Motivation

Lux-Chain aims to be:

- simple,
- interoperable,
- chain-agnostic,
- long-lived.

To achieve this, it needs a **widely available, well-understood hash function**
that is:

- battle-tested in production,  
- supported in virtually all programming languages,  
- compatible with major blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.),  
- free of licensing restrictions.

SHA-256 fulfills these requirements.

---

## 3. Proposal

All Lux-Chain compliant implementations MUST support **SHA-256** as the
default hash function for:

- `proof` field in the Proof Object (see RFC-0001),  
- any internal commitment required by the implementation,  
- optional off-chain logging of exchange identifiers.  

Example:

```text
proof = SHA256( tx_hash || timestamp || random_nonce )
```

Where `||` denotes concatenation in a well-defined encoding.

## 4. Impact

### 4.1 Benefits

- **Interoperability:** shared minimum standard across different languages and
  platforms.  
- **Simplicity:** most environments already include SHA-256 libraries.  
- **Auditability:** security properties are widely analyzed and documented.  

### 4.2 Risks / Limitations

- SHA-256 is **not post-quantum resistant**; quantum-resistant alternatives may
  be considered in future LPIPs for optional or additional use.  
- Implementations MUST NOT assume SHA-256 alone guarantees full security in
  presence of poor key management or weak randomness.

---

## 5. Alternatives

Future LPIPs MAY introduce:

- additional hash options (e.g. BLAKE3) as **optional** algorithms,  
- post-quantum hash recommendations,  
- domain separation tags for specific protocol uses.  

However, SHA-256 MUST remain the **minimum common denominator** for Lux-Chain
compliance unless explicitly superseded by a later LPIP.

---

## 6. Eternal Clause Check

This LPIP:

- does **not** introduce custody,  
- does **not** require permission to use the protocol,  
- does **not** restrict forks or derivative implementations.  

Therefore, it fully respects the eternal clauses defined in LPIP-0001.
