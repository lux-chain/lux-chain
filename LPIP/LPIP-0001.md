# LPIP-0001 — Lux Protocol Improvement Process (LPIP)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Active (Foundational)  
**Date:** 2025-12-02  
**License:** MIT  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **minimum, transparent and non-centralized process**
for proposing, discussing, and adopting changes to the Lux-Chain protocol.

Its goal is to protect the core principles of Lux-Chain while allowing
evolution over time.

---

## 2. Eternal Clauses (Unchangeable)

All LPIPs, present and future, MUST respect these three **eternal clauses**:

1. **No Custody**  
   No proposal may introduce custody of third-party funds at the protocol level.

2. **No Permission**  
   No proposal may require permission from any authority, entity, or role
   to use the protocol.

3. **Fork Freedom**  
   No proposal may restrict the right to fork, copy, modify or re-implement
   the protocol in any form.

Any LPIP that violates these clauses is **invalid by definition**, regardless
of discussion or apparent consensus.

These clauses themselves **cannot be removed or weakened** by any future LPIP.

---

## 3. What is an LPIP?

An LPIP (Lux Protocol Improvement Proposal) is a document that:

- Proposes a change, clarification, or extension to the protocol.  
- Uses clear and concise language.  
- Is open to public discussion.  
- Has a technical, ethical, or structural impact on Lux-Chain.

Anyone may write an LPIP. There is no membership, no council, no ownership.

---

## 4. LPIP Structure

Each LPIP file SHOULD include:

1. **Header**  
   - Title  
   - Version  
   - Status (Proposed, Active, Rejected, Superseded)  
   - Date  
   - License  

2. **Summary**  
   One or two paragraphs: what is being proposed.

3. **Motivation**  
   Why this change is needed, what problem it solves.

4. **Proposal**  
   Exact description of the change or addition.

5. **Impact**  
   - Benefits  
   - Risks  
   - Compatibility notes  

6. **Eternal Clause Check**  
   Short section stating how the proposal respects:
   - No Custody  
   - No Permission  
   - Fork Freedom  

7. **License**  
   MIT (or compatible open license).

## 5. Process Flow

### 5.1 Proposal

- An author writes an LPIP in Markdown.  
- A GitHub Issue is opened in the main `lux-chain` repository, linking the LPIP.  
- The LPIP file is added under the `/LPIP/` directory (as a pull request).  

### 5.2 Discussion

- The community comments in the GitHub Issue and/or the Pull Request.  
- Discussion SHOULD remain public, technical, and documented.  
- Minimum discussion period: **7 days** from creation.

### 5.3 Rough Consensus

Lux-Chain adopts a **rough consensus** model:

- No formal voting mechanism is required.  
- Support is signaled through comments, reviews, and independent
  implementations.  
- Blockers MUST be technical, ethical, or security-based, not political.  

If, after discussion, there are no unresolved blocking arguments and the
eternal clauses are respected, the proposal may be accepted.

### 5.4 Acceptance

- The LPIP is merged into the `/LPIP/` folder in the main repository.  
- Status is set to **Active**.  
- Implementations MAY begin referencing it as a normative document.

### 5.5 Rejection

An LPIP may be rejected if:

- It violates one or more eternal clauses.  
- It adds unnecessary complexity without strong motivation.  
- It duplicates existing mechanisms without clear advantage.  

Rejections MUST be documented in the original Issue and/or PR with reasons.

### 5.6 Superseding

A newer LPIP may supersede an older one by:

- Explicitly stating which LPIP it replaces.  
- Maintaining compatibility when possible.  
- Respecting the eternal clauses.

The older LPIP status becomes **Superseded**.

---

## 6. Governance Model

Lux-Chain has **no council, no foundation, no formal governance token.**

The actual power lies in:

- Who writes clear LPIPs.  
- Who implements them.  
- Who adopts them in real systems.  

This RFC does not define roles such as “core devs” or “maintainers” as sources
of authority. Influence is earned through clarity, usefulness, and alignment
with the eternal clauses.

---

## 7. Compatibility with Lux-Chain Thesis

This process is consistent with the **Lux-Chain Thesis**:

- Authority is replaced by time and clarity.  
- Forking remains a protected right.  
- No single group can capture the protocol.  

Any attempt to introduce formal centralized governance at the protocol level
would contradict this document and is considered **non-compliant** with
Lux-Chain.

## 8. License

This LPIP and all related process documentation are released under the MIT
License, allowing free use, modification, and forking.

---

## 9. Status

**Active** — This LPIP defines the baseline improvement process for the
Lux-Chain protocol and SHOULD be referenced by all future LPIPs.
