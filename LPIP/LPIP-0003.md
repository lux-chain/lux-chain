# LPIP-0003 — Recommended TimeLock / Timeout Structure

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Active  
**Date:** 2025-12-02  
**License:** MIT

## 1. Summary

This LPIP defines a **recommended TimeLock / timeout structure** for Lux-Chain
exchanges, to ensure that locked value is not held indefinitely and that both
parties retain a guaranteed exit path.

Default recommendation: **72 hours (3 days)** for general-purpose exchanges,
with a small set of standardized options.

---

## 2. Motivation

Without a clear timeout mechanism, value could remain locked:

- indefinitely,
- under dispute,
- or due to implementation bugs / UI failures.

Lux-Chain, as a non-custodial protocol, must guarantee that **each party can
regain control of its own funds** after a reasonable period, without appealing
to any central authority.

Time, not authority, is the arbiter.

---

## 3. Proposal

Each Lux-Chain exchange MUST define a `timeout` value in seconds.

Recommended standard options:

- `24h`  (86 400 seconds)  
- `48h`  (172 800 seconds)  
- `72h`  (259 200 seconds) ← **default**  
- `7d`   (604 800 seconds)  

Implementations SHOULD:

- offer these as presets in user interfaces,  
- document which default is being used,  
- allow advanced users to override the timeout where appropriate.  

When `current_time >= start_time + timeout` and the exchange is still
`LOCKED`, the implementation MUST attempt a **REFUND** according to the
underlying chain’s capabilities (HTLC, multisig, or equivalent).

---

## 4. Impact

### 4.1 Benefits

- Guarantees that no user is trapped in a perpetual LOCKED state.  
- Reduces the need for external arbitration.  
- Aligns with Lux-Chain’s goal of replacing authority with time.  

### 4.2 Risks

- Too short timeouts may not be suitable for physical goods or long settlement
  flows.  
- Too long timeouts may reduce perceived usability or capital efficiency.

Implementations MAY allow custom timeouts where needed, as long as a refund
path exists and is clearly communicated.

---

## 5. Compatibility

This LPIP is fully compatible with:

- `RFC-0001` (state machine and TimeLock behavior),  
- `LPIP-0002` (hash function does not depend on timeout),  
- higher-level UX / application flows built on top of Lux-Chain.

---

## 6. Eternal Clause Check

This LPIP:

- does **not** introduce custody,  
- does **not** require permission,  
- does **not** restrict forks.  

It reinforces the principle that **each user retains control of their funds**
through time-based resolution, respecting LPIP-0001.
