# LPIP-0004 — Optional zk-Proofs for Privacy-Conscious Usage

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-12-02  
**License:** MIT  

---

## 1. Summary

This LPIP introduces an **optional** mechanism for using zero-knowledge proofs
(zk-proofs) in Lux-Chain implementations, allowing parties to prove certain
properties about an exchange **without revealing the underlying data.**

zk-proofs are **not required** for Lux-Chain compliance.

---

## 2. Motivation

Some exchanges may require additional privacy or confidentiality guarantees,
for example:

- proving that an amount is within a range,  
- proving that a certain condition holds,  
- hiding the exact nature of the asset, while preserving verifiability.  

Zero-knowledge proofs allow verification without disclosure, aligned with
Lux-Chain’s principle of **minimal exposure with sufficient proof.**

---

## 3. Proposal

Extend the Proof Object schema with an optional `zk` field:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "id": "lux-<timestamp>-<random>",
  "tx": "0xHASH",
  "state": "CLOSED",
  "result": "RELEASED or REFUNDED",
  "proof": "SHA256(...data)",
  "timestamp": 1700000000,
  "chain": "ANY",
  "zk": "ZKPROOF_BLOB_OR_REFERENCE",
  "meta": {}
}
```

Where:

- `zk` MAY contain a serialized zk-SNARK / zk-STARK proof or a reference to it.  
- The exact format of `zk` is left to implementations and future LPIPs.  

Implementations MAY:

- provide optional circuits for common use cases,  
- integrate with existing zk toolchains (circom, Halo2, etc.),  
- ignore `zk` if they do not support zero-knowledge features.

## 4. Impact

### 4.1 Benefits

- Enables privacy-conscious usage without changing core protocol behavior.  
- Allows gradual, opt-in adoption of advanced cryptography.  
- Compatible with Layer 2 rollups and zk-enabled blockchains.  

### 4.2 Risks

- Increased implementation complexity.  
- Higher computational costs for proof generation/verification.  
- Potential for security issues if circuits are poorly designed.

These risks are **implementation-specific** and do not affect the core protocol
as defined in RFC-0001.

---

## 5. Compatibility

This LPIP is fully compatible with:

- `RFC-0001` (Proof Object remains valid without `zk`),  
- `LPIP-0001` (no change to eternal clauses),  
- `LPIP-0002` (hash remains SHA-256 for baseline proof).  

`zk` is purely additive and optional.

---

## 6. Eternal Clause Check

This LPIP:

- does **not** introduce custody,  
- does **not** require permission to use Lux-Chain,  
- does **not** restrict forks or derivative protocols.  

It simply adds an optional privacy layer that users MAY adopt.
