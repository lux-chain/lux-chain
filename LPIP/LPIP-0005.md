# LPIP-0005 — Recommended Languages for Client Implementations

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-12-02  
**License:** MIT  

---

## 1. Summary

This LPIP recommends a set of **primary languages** for Lux-Chain client
implementations, in order to encourage interoperability, audits, and broad
adoption, while keeping the protocol itself language-agnostic.

---

## 2. Motivation

Although Lux-Chain is a specification and not a codebase, having a small set
of recommended implementation languages helps:

- new developers onboard quickly,  
- auditors focus their efforts,  
- ecosystems reuse components and examples,  
- education and documentation efforts stay coherent.  

---

## 3. Proposal

The following languages are RECOMMENDED for official or reference client
implementations:

- **JavaScript / TypeScript** (web, Node.js, dApps)  
- **Python** (scripting, tooling, research)  
- **Go** (servers, CLI tools, infrastructure)  
- **Rust** (high-performance, safety-critical components)  
- **Java** (enterprise, Android, legacy environments)  

Additionally, the following languages are suggested for smart contract or
on-chain components where applicable:

- **Solidity** (EVM-based chains)  
- **Move** (Aptos, Sui)  
- **Cadence** (Flow)  

This list is **non-exclusive** and MAY be expanded by future LPIPs.

---

## 4. Minimal Client Interface

All clients SHOULD implement a minimal logical interface equivalent to:

```ts
lux.connect(walletA, walletB)
lux.lock(amount, timeout)
lux.release()
lux.refund()
lux.proof()
```

Where:

- `lock` transitions an exchange to `LOCKED`,  
- `release` transitions `LOCKED → RELEASED → CLOSED`,  
- `refund` transitions `LOCKED → REFUNDED → CLOSED`,  
- `proof` returns the Proof Object as defined in RFC-0001.

Function names MAY vary, but semantics MUST be preserved.

---

## 5. Impact

### 5.1 Benefits

- Clarifies where to focus early reference implementations.  
- Enables cross-language testing and fuzzing.  
- Eases educational materials and examples.  

### 5.2 Risks

- Perception that non-listed languages are “second-class citizens”.  
- Possible fragmentation if implementations diverge heavily.

These risks are mitigated by keeping the list **recommendatory, not mandatory**.

---

## 6. Eternal Clause Check

This LPIP:

- does **not** introduce custody,  
- does **not** add permission checks,  
- does **not** restrict forks or non-recommended languages.  

Any language or stack MAY implement Lux-Chain, provided it respects RFC-0001
and LPIP-0001.
